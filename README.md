## Project Overview: Data Cleaning Service with Dash

### Introduction
This project develops a web-based data cleaning service using Python and Dash, a popular framework for building interactive web applications purely in Python. The service provides an interface for users to manage data cleaning configurations and process CSV files according to specified mappings and transformations. The application is designed to facilitate efficient data preprocessing tasks through a user-friendly dashboard.

### Key Features
1. **Configuration Management**:
   - **YAML Configuration**: The application uses a `config.yml` file to store and manage data configurations which include target formats and source-to-target mappings.
   - **Interactive Editing**: Users can dynamically edit the target and source configurations through a web interface, adding, removing, and modifying entries as needed.

2. **Data Cleaning Workflow**:
   - **CSV Upload and Field Analysis**: Users can upload CSV files and select data fields for detailed statistical analysis, including histograms and descriptive statistics.
   - **Data Transformation**: Based on user-defined mappings in the configuration, the application processes the uploaded CSV files, mapping source fields to target fields as specified.
   - **Data Visualization**: Provides visual feedback through graphs that display statistical distributions and summaries of the data fields.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - **Step-by-Step Interface**: The web interface is organized into tabs that guide the user through the process of configuring target and source schemas, analyzing data fields, and performing data cleaning operations.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Users receive real-time feedback on operations such as saving configurations or processing data, enhancing the interactivity and usability of the service.

4. **Tech Stack**:
   - **Python**: Utilizes Python for backend processing, leveraging libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for data visualization.
   - **Dash**: Built with Dash, enabling a reactive, Pythonic way to build interactive web apps without requiring JavaScript.

### Usage Scenarios
The service is ideal for data scientists, analysts, and software developers who need a straightforward tool to clean and preprocess data files routinely. By simplifying the data cleaning process through a graphical interface, users can focus more on analyzing data rather than dealing with the intricacies of data preparation.

### Getting Started
#### Installation
1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://python.org).
2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
